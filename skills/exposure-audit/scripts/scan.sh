# Prints marker-prefixed lines so the calling agent can build a report without
# re-deriving anything:
#   SCOPE:   what exists (repos, ports, domains, deployments)
#   FINDING: a check that failed, with the evidence
#   CLEAN:   a check that passed, with the method
#   NOTRUN:  a check that did not complete, with the reason
#
# Never prints a secret value. Keys are shown as NAME + 7-char prefix only.
# Never calls a state-changing endpoint. Never follows redirects. Never writes anything.
#
# Optional inputs:
#   DOMAINS="yoursite.com another.com"   domains to check for exposed keys and headers
#   SYNC_DIRS="$HOME/Desktop $HOME/Dropbox"  cloud-synced folders to sweep for .env files
#   OWNERS="my-login my-org"            whose repos get the deep history scan
#
# Tested on macOS. Needs git, curl and perl. Uses gh and npm where available and
# reports NOTRUN when they are missing rather than skipping silently.
